\section{Introduction}

The bin packing problem is a widely researched problem\\
BPP can be stated as follows:

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textcolor{red}{original BPP}
	\item Definition of problem: packing items of different sizes into a finite number of bins/containers that have a fixed size such that the number of bins/containers required is minimised.
	\item Combinatorial NP-hard problem (computational complexity)
	\item NP-Complete (decision problem)
	\item Heuristics
	\item FF and FFD
	\item FF can produce a feasible solution quickly, but the solution may not be optimal O(nln n), n is the number of items that need to be packed.
	\item ``There exists at least one ordering of items that allows FF to produce an optimal solution'' (wiki)
	\item ``bound for FFD is tight'' (wiki)
	\item 2015 Hoberg and Rothvoss proposed and proofed a new complexity for the algorithm FF (wiki)
	\item Exact algorithms, Martello and Toth (MTP), Bin Completion algorithm Korf 2002, Schreiber and Korf (2013) (wiki)
	
	\item \textcolor{red}{Score constraints}	
	\item Goulimis 2004, score constraints for packing and folding
	\item Explain knives for scoring
	\item Picture of box with score widths, score lines
	\item All boxes have same height, different widths, different score widths
	\item ``Threshold'' ``minimum knife distance'' ``minimum score separation constraint'' ``minimum score line distance'', ``minimum score line constraint'' 70mm industry
	\item Becker alg exact, P, but without packing, all boxes on one strip
	\item \textcolor{red}{Multiple strips}
	\item Material may not come in long sizes, instead short sizes of fixed length
	\item find optimal arrangement of boxes on strips while mimimising waste and number of strips required
	
	\item Formal statement of BPP with score constraint
	
	\item layout of paper
\end{itemize}
