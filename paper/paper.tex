\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

The one-dimensional bin packing problem (BPP) is a combinatorial optimisation problem that has been widely researched and discussed due to its ability to model a variety of real-life sitations.
The BPP can be described as follows: given a set of $n$ items of varying sizes $w$, and a finite number of bins with equal capacity $c$, find the minimum number of bins required to contain all of the items. As shown by \cite{garey1979}, this problem is NP-hard, and therefore (under the assumption that $P \neq NP$) there is no known algorithm that is able to find an optimal solution in polynomial time for every instance of the BPP. Instead, heursitics can be used to find a near-optimal solution in a shorter amount of time. One example is the greedy heuristic known as first-fit, an online algorithm that places each item (in some arbitrary order) into the lowest-indexed bin. If there are no bins that can feasibly accommodate the item, the algorithm places the item into a new bin. A modified version of first-fit yields the well-known first-fit decreasing (FFD) algorithm (\cite{eilon1971}), which initially sorts the items into non-decreasing order of size before allocating them into bins. As proven by \cite{dosa2007}, the worst case for FFD is $\frac{11}{9}k + 4$ bins, where $k$ is the optimal number of bins given by $\ceil{\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} w_{i}}{c}}$ (\cite{korf2002}).



In 2004, Goulimis brought to light an open-combinatorial problem related to the bin-packing problem. Corrugated boxes are formed in two stages: firstly, they are produced flat, then a device consistsing of knives mounted on a bar creates ``scores'' along fold lines on the flat boxes. These scores allow the boxes to be folded in predetermined places. The first stage of this process involves finding a feasible pattern of the flat boxes that minimises the amount of waste, and has been researched extensively. It is classically solved by delayed column-generation \citep{gilmore1961, gilmore1963}. However, the second step of this process requires an additional constraint.

The scoring knives, by design, cannot be placed too close together (around 70mm in industry), and as such have a ``minimum knife distance''. The problem then becomes a bin-packing problem with an additional constraint: find a feasible arrangement of boxes such that the sum of two adjacent score widths from different boxes is greater than or equal to the minimum knife distance. We will call this constraint the minimum total width constraint.

There exists a polynomial time algorithm that is able to recognise whether a particular instance of the problem is feasible or infeasible (\cite{becker2010}) (i.e. whether all boxes can be arranged in one line). However, the algorithm does not consider the lengths of each individual box, or the total length of the final arrangement of boxes. In industry, strips of materials are provided in fixed lengths, so, given a large number of boxes to pack, it may not be feasible to pack all of the boxes onto one strip. 

This leads us to our main problem: given a collection of boxes with varying widths and score widths on either side, and strips of a fixed length, find the minimum number of strips required to accommodate all of the boxes, such that the minimum total width constraint is met between all boxes on all strips. 

The remainder of this report will firstly, in Section \ref{sec:ffdapprox}, introduce the first-fit decreasing approximate algorithm and describe the modifications made to consider the minimum score width constraint. In Section \ref{sec:ffdexact}, we will present a new algorithm which consists of the modified first-fit decreasing algorithm detailed in the previous section combined with a polynomial-time algorithm which will be used to find feasible sub-solutions. A comparison of the two algorithms and an analysis of the results will be provided in Section \ref{sec:compresult}, and finally Section \ref{sec:conclusion} concludes the paper and proposes some potential directions for furture work.
